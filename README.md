Repository used to keep projects created during learning. Some of them are from beggining stages, some more complex. Note that some of the code could have been written in simpler way, however, I wanted to apply gained knowledge as soon I learnt it.

Some of the ideas originated from Angela Yu's "100 Days of Code" python tutorial on Udemy, make sure you check it out!
